# Intermittent Firebase Data Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Firebase project where data writes using the `set()` method were inconsistently failing. The problem manifested as data sometimes not appearing in the database despite successful `set()` calls.  The issue was intermittent and only observed in the production environment.

## Bug Description

The core issue was that data written to the Firebase Realtime Database using `set()` would randomly fail to persist.  Error handling didn't capture any specific exceptions; the `set()` call would complete without error, yet the data would be absent. 

## Solution

The solution involved implementing more robust error handling, including checks for network connectivity and a retry mechanism for failed writes. By using a promise and then calling .catch we can log an error message for debugging purposes.

## Reproduction Steps

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the Firebase SDK (`npm install firebase`).
3.  Configure your Firebase project credentials in `firebaseConfig.js`.
4.  Run `firebaseBug.js`. Observe intermittent data write failures.
5.  Run `firebaseBugSolution.js`. Observe the improved reliability of data writes.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of thorough error handling, especially when working with asynchronous operations and external services like Firebase.  Simple logging may not reveal subtle intermittent failures, necessitating more sophisticated approaches to ensure data integrity.
